1. Core Concepts & Architecture
The application is designed as a multi-tenant API management workspace. Its primary purpose is to allow a user to interact with different deployments (tenants) of a single customer's API, facilitate data comparison between these tenants, and ensure safe data handling practices, especially concerning Personal Data.

The architecture remains a decoupled system, with a React Single Page Application (SPA) for the frontend and a Fastify server for the backend API and proxy.

Profile: This is now a user-centric space for managing application-wide preferences, such as theme settings (e.g., Light vs. Dark Mode).

Workspace: This is the user's primary container for organizing their work. A workspace holds multiple Customer Projects.

Customer Project: Represents a single customer's API ecosystem. A project contains a shared API schema and a set of tenant configurations.

Tenant Endpoint: Represents a specific deployment of the customer's API (e.g., Development, Testing, Staging, Production). Each tenant has a unique host but shares the same fundamental API structure defined in the project.

2. Updated Database Schema
To support the new requirements, the database schema must be restructured to model the relationships between projects, tenants, and schemas accurately.

    User ||--|{ Profile : "has"
    User ||--|{ CustomerProject : "manages"
    CustomerProject ||--|{ TenantEndpoint : "has"

    User {
        int id PK
        string email UK
        string name
    }
    Profile {
        int id PK
        string theme "e.g., 'light' or 'dark'"
        int userId FK
    }
    CustomerProject {
        int id PK
        string name
        json piiFields "['user.email', 'user.address']"
        int userId FK
    }
    TenantEndpoint {
        int id PK
        string name "e.g., 'Development', 'Production'"
        string host "https://api.customer-dev.com"
        string type "DEV, TEST, PROD"
        int customerProjectId FK
    }
Key Schema Changes & Justification:

CustomerProject: This is the central model. It contains the project's name and, critically, a piiFields JSON field.

Why piiFields?: Storing this configuration at the project level allows a user to define which data fields are sensitive across all tenants of that API. This is the most logical place to manage this rule, as the data structure is consistent across tenants. It will store an array of dot-notation strings (e.g., ['user.email', 'address.street']) for easy parsing.

TenantEndpoint: This model replaces the generic ApiEndpoint. It explicitly stores the name (e.g., "Production"), the host (the base URL), and a type enum (DEV, TEST, PROD).

Why?: This structure directly models the one-to-many relationship where one project has multiple deployment tenants. The type field is crucial for the backend to apply different rules (e.g., disallowing POST in PROD).

3. Backend API Enhancements
The Fastify backend's responsibilities will expand significantly, particularly in the proxy logic.

CRUD Endpoints: Standard CRUD routes for CustomerProject and TenantEndpoint are required.

Intelligent Proxy Endpoint (POST /api/proxy/execute): This endpoint becomes the core of the application's logic. When it receives a request from the frontend, it must perform the following steps:

Identify Tenant Type: Using the tenantId from the request, look up the TenantEndpoint in the database to determine its type (e.g., PROD).

Enforce Permissions:

If the tenant type is PROD or STAGING and the HTTP method is POST, PUT, or DELETE, the API should reject the request with an error by default. This is a critical safety feature.

These permissions should be configurable in the future but will start with safe defaults.

Apply PII Filtering:

If the tenant type is PROD, before sending the request, the backend will consult the piiFields configuration for the project.

This feature will initially be focused on response filtering. After receiving data from the production API, the proxy will parse the response and remove or mask the fields defined in piiFields before sending the data back to the frontend.

Data Comparison Endpoint (POST /api/proxy/diff): This new endpoint is required for the data comparison use case.

It will accept two tenantIds (e.g., tenantAId and tenantBId) and the request details (path, payload).

The backend will make two parallel calls to the respective tenant hosts.

It will then perform a deep comparison of the two JSON responses and return a structured "diff" object to the frontend, highlighting additions, deletions, and modifications.

Mock Data Generation Endpoint (POST /api/proxy/mock):

This endpoint will accept a tenantId and a request payload.

It will identify any fields in the payload that are marked as PII.

Using an integrated library (like faker.js), it will replace the PII values with realistic but fake data before forwarding the request to the TEST tenant. This ensures that real personal data is not accidentally used in testing environments.

4. Frontend UI/UX Evolution (React)
The React SPA will need a more sophisticated layout and component set to handle the new features.

Navigation: A top-level navigation bar is needed to switch between the main Workspace view and the user's Profile page.

Workspace View:

The project/tenant list on the left remains, but it will now display CustomerProjects and their nested TenantEndpoints.

When a user selects an endpoint, it loads in the central Request Builder panel. A clear, color-coded badge (e.g., ðŸ”´ PROD, ðŸŸ¡ STAGING, ðŸŸ¢ DEV) must be prominently displayed to constantly remind the user which environment they are targeting.

Comparison Mode UI:

The UI needs a mechanism, perhaps a "Compare" button, to enter a comparison mode.

In this mode, the user can select a second tenant. The ResponsePanel will then split into a two-panel "diff" view.

This view will display the two responses side-by-side, with clear visual highlighting (e.g., red for deletions, green for additions) for any differences found in the data, powered by the response from the /api/proxy/diff endpoint.

Project Settings UI:

Within each project, there must be a "Settings" tab or modal.

This interface will allow the user to view and edit the piiFields list, providing a simple text area or a tag-based input for managing the list of sensitive fields.

Write-Action Confirmation:

When a user attempts to use POST or PUT on a DEV or TEST tenant, the UI should present a confirmation modal (e.g., "You are about to modify data in the DEV environment. Are you sure?") as a final safety check.
